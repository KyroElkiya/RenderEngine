Render Optimisation for large scale meshes:

I have added max recursion depth to my bvh, so it doesnt try narrowing down every bbox to a single triangle


Missing Tris issue:

i have fixed aabb's ray intersection code
missing triangle issue, fix was lowering the min tri count to 1 rather than 8


NaN issue:

tried adding ray normalization safeguard in renderer.h
tried adding safe inverse for aabb adinv 

Added NaN detector into color.h
Added NaN detector into renderer.h

Created NaN detector script for vec3 class in debug utils

narrowed down to NaNs being in pixel color
narrowed down to NaNs being in scattered.direction()
narrowed down to NaNs being in ray_hit_info.N
narrowed down to NaNs being from triPrim normal calculation

FIXED IT!

RENDERED FIRST TIME WORKING WITH THE HIGH POLY NO NANS AT 363.095 SECONDS
